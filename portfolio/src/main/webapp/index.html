      <h1>Michael's Portfolio</h1>
      
      <p>
        I am a rising junior studying Computer Science with a 
        concentration in computer systems at Carnegie Mellon 
        University. As of right now, I plan to graduate in Spring 2022
      </p>
      <p>
        At school I enjoy competing in hackathons and have even won one of 
        the ones I attended! The competition is quite fun and it lets me 
        exercise my coding skills in an environment against my peers and
        everyone is a winner if they create something they're proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of school, I love to mountain bike and play video games. However anything that 
        is outdoorsy is fair game to me. Mountain biking is definitely where I spend much of my free
        time outside of school and programming. My competitive drive even lead me to participate in several 
        races, one of which I placed third in. The sense of community in the mountain bike community is like no 
        other and I feel at home there.
        With friends I go out to explore the city of Pittsburgh where there
        are many things to do, be it museums or something else.

                            my professor for Humanoids, a freeform class where we were 
                            encouraged to explore whatever interested us in the CS/Robotics
                            field. Uses TensorFlow and a high frequency radar hosted on a 
                            Raspberry Pi in order to sense the densities and other characteristics
                            of a material in order to classify them accordingly. Got to greater than
                            90 percent accuracy but needed more accurate equipment which unfortunately
                            could not be acquired due to not being on campus because of coronavirus :(

                      Final term project in which I created an application where someone could 
                      take a gpx recording of some outdoor activity such as mountain biking or
                      hiking and the application would find all the differing loops in the trail and 
                      categorize them according to difficulty. This was all stored in a backend SQL 
                      database where multiple users could store their gps data seperately and could be 
                      selected upon login.
